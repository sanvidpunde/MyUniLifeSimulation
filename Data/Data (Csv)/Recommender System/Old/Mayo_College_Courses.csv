Bookkeepers and payroll staff are more than just number-crunchers; while numerical proficiency is obviously important - they face a wide variety of professional challenges and technical duties in addition to calculations – they need to be able to communicate with colleagues across the organisation, and externally.

Depending on their organisation size, bookkeepers/payroll administrators may have to deal with multiple tasks and duties at any given time, so an organised, logical approach to work will be essential. These staff work as part of a team, and therefore also need to be a flexible, creative-thinker in order to address unexpected problems and scenarios quickly and effectively.

Bookkeeping and payroll processes can sometimes be stressful in meeting staff requests and strict compliance requirements, therefore, the individual must be able to work under pressure, without compromising performance standards. Good timekeeping and an ability to meet strict deadlines is an essential part of these roles, as they will need to deliver projects/salaries, wages and payslips on time. In practice, this means being able to prioritise and delegate to ensure the task is completed to deadline. 

This course will:

Teach you the basics of bookkeeping
Teach you skills consistent with the current principles and practices in the field
Enhance your career prospects
Develop your confidence and accuracy within Bookkeeping roles
Give you the skills and knowledge to deal with multiple tasks at any given time","Bookkeepers work in close proximity with core business operations to ensure that the most economically viable and safe decisions are made to keep finances and budgets under control.

It examines the tools to identify threat actors. Models and frameworks are followed to manage the response. Data analytics can use tools such as machine learning to identify anomalies in organisational IT traffic.

Cybersecurity Operations involves implementing secure architecture to defend against vulnerable systems. It can be considered the stage when risk and compliance has failed.

This Masters provides a pathway for IT professionals to upskill in the area of cybersecurity operations. Developed in partnership with HPE, a learner can pursue a major L9 award through 4 x 10 credit taught modules and completing a 50-credit thesis","The taught modules are delivered in year one of the Masters and prepares the learner for independent, delt-directed thesis research in the domain of cybersecurity operations  

Incident Detection & Response (10 Credits) 

When Risk & Compliance fails, an organization must respond to cyber incidents. All IT practitioners and security operations personnel need to have the skills to systematically neutralize a threat. These steps include identifying a threat, employing quarantine measures and implementing robust measures to mitigate against future compromises. Engineering models and frameworks such as Mitre ATT&CK are explored as a means of analysing organisational data, identifying mitigating threats. 

Programming for Data Analytics (10 Credits) 

Incident detection identifies threat actors operating within an organization’s IT infrastructure. Using data analytic tools and machine learning, IT security personnel can forensically examine and identify anomalous activity, potentially being a malicious threat. Coding is an integral part of designing bespoke analytical tools and this module explores the programming languages necessary for data interpretation and visualisation.  

Secure Operations (10 Credits) 

An organization endeavours to secure its IT architecture against threats. Vulnerability management ensures elements of this architecture are configured and secured correctly. Implementing robust defences is the best method to mitigate against these threats. Preparedness for an incident is as important as incident response. 

Research Methods and Critical Analysis (10 Credits) 

Theoretical concepts, research paradigms and critical readings relevant to the field of academic or professional applied research will be explored. Epistemological and ontological considerations will be discussed in relation to research design and learners will reflect on the challenges of carrying out empirical social research in their particular workplace or specialist field of application. Students will reflect upon some of the ethical, societal and practical problems of data collection, including sampling, gaining access to the field, designing a research instrument and the principles of qualitative and quantitative analysis.  

 

The Thesis or Dissertation can be pursued in parallel with the year two modules and completed in year two. 

Thesis/Dissertation (50 Credits) 

This applied research thesis or dissertation module provides the mechanism for learners to carry out an in-depth, independent investigation, analysis and presentation of a research topic; organisational or workplace innovation dilemma of their choosing, related to the relevant academic discipline and/or professional field. This Applied Research Project or Dissertation module requires the learner to conceptualise, design, conduct, analyse and formally write up, then visually / orally present a substantial research project or workplace innovation/intervention to postgraduate research standard.

The minimum entry requirements are a Level 8 qualification in an IT related discipline.
