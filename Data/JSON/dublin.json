Dental technicians work to the prescription of a dentist; they perform the laboratory aspects of dentistry – fabricating crowns and bridges, dentures, implants, maxillofacial and orthodontic appliances, which are intended for use by the patient. Dental technicians have good manual dexterity skills and are required to work with different materials for the fabrication of the various appliances. Dental technology is a changing field, with more emphasis on the use of CAD (Computer Aided Design)/CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) in the laboratory.   The study of dental technology will appeal to you if you are interested in science and art, combined with working in a team. If you have an interest in oral health and are simultaneously creatively minded then dental technology may be for you. A good background in basic sciences and a flair for art or good manual dexterity skills are essential to becoming an excellent dental technician. Dental technology also requires precise and scientific expression therefore, good writing skills are important.  Dental Technology at Trinity Trinity College Dublin is the only university in Ireland offering a degree in Dental Technology. The course is based in the Dublin Dental University Hospital, on the Trinity College, with state-of-the-art facilities, including Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) of dental appliances in close proximity to the clinical environment. Class sizes are small, ensuring that students receive considerable staff contact and the staff are actively involved in student progress throughout the programme.",
  "course_content": "Dental Technology at Trinity is a three-year ordinary degree programme. Most of the teaching takes place in the Dublin Dental University Hospital (DDUH). The main aim of the course is to educate and train students to become part of the dental team for the planning, designing and fabrication of intra-oral appliances. Dental Technology is divided into four main areas – fixed prosthodontics, complete denture technology, removable denture technology and orthodontic technology. In the first and second years, a Dental Technology student will spend much of their time (6-8 x 3 hour sessions per week) in the DDUH teaching laboratory. The course is very much hands-on right from the start. Student numbers are small (6), which facilitates practical training of this nature. There is a strong emphasis on student integration with Dental Science students and some modules are integrated accordingly.  In the third year, students are assigned to the production laboratory for experience in providing a service to patients and clinicians. This offers a competitive advantage over graduates from many other universities. Liaison with the Dental Science students and clinical staff is encouraged and students are advised to attend in the clinic to observe their completed work in situ. There is the opportunity for students to be placed in external laboratories and there is a possibility of Erasmus exchange in this year too. Students will be busy throughout the year preparing a dissertation, which is presented at the end of the year in addition to a case portfolio of the practical work which the student has carried out over the course of the year.  First year modules Fixed Prosthodontic Technology and Occlusion and Function Complete and Removable Partial Denture Technology Orthodontic Technology Physics Chemistry Second year modules Fixed Prosthodontic Technology Complete Denture Technology Orthodontic Technology Removable Partial Denture Technology Materials Science Business Studies Third year modules Fixed Prosthodontic Technology Complete Denture and Removable Partial Denture Technology Orthodontic Technology Dissertation",

  "course_description": "This four-year course focuses on the creation and study of games. It covers the design and development of digital and analogue games, including PC, mobile, Web, card and board games.  Topics include in-depth analysis of games, practical hands-on development experience and theoretical game studies. Along the way, you’ll also learn important industry skills such as programming, game design, digital media asset creation, project management and game publishing. You will develop an in-depth understanding of the concepts, theories and models of game design and how they can be applied to both commercial and serious game development.   You will be able to analyse and determine multiple approaches to game design, gameplay mechanics, UI controls and the context within which they’re used. You’ll use advanced skills from specialist areas to achieve goals, including the design and implementation of complex game systems, documentation of the design process, testing and publishing games.   In Year 3, this is a focus on gaining real-world experience. Students will have the opportunity to get experience working with an external serious game partner, industry work experience or study abroad through an Erasmus exchange.  During the course, you will be continuously making games, from year 1 to year 4. You will work on both individual and team projects. Teamwork is an essential skill in the games industry and you will work in different teams to develop important soft skills such as communications and group decision making.  In your final year, you will complete a major game project demonstrating your full range of design and development skills.  IT Requirements: A personal laptop of sufficient specifications for game development is highly recommended. In general, most mid-high end gaming laptops should suffice for development. VR/AR development may require higher spec machines.",

  "course_description": "This course is subject to validation  This four-year course prepares you for a career in professional accountancy and finance and can lead to a contact with an accounting practice. You don’t need to have studied any Leaving Certificate Accounting, Business or Economics subjects. We start at an introductory level, which will prepare you for the more complex concepts that you meet at a later stage in the course. All modules gradually develop students' knowledge with each module building on the knowledge acquired in previous semesters.   One of the core goals of our department is to enrich the development of our graduates to maximise their employment potential and we embrace the 'T Graduate' concept as a model to achieve this.   Our core disciplinary skills, as exemplified in the 'T Graduate' concept, are evidenced in the exemptions awarded by professional bodies.  We compliment these skills with strong interpersonal and computer skills.  Along with obtaining skills on accounting packages, the management of big data and an understanding of the digital enablers for accountants, students will also have the opportunity to obtain Microsoft Professional Accreditation.   Professional Accreditation: On graduation, you’ll qualify for generous exemptions from the professional accountancy bodies, including ACA, ACCA, CIMA, CPA and The Irish Tax Institute.  Progression and Exit Awards: Should your circumstances change, you can postpone your studies or continue them part-time in the evening  or you can exit the course at Level 6 (exiting with a Level 6 Higher Certificate in Accounting) or Level 7 (Bachelor of Business in Accounting & Finance)  Career Planning & Preparation The course is complimented with a Professional Communication & Work Place Preparation module. This provides the students with broader professional communication skills through detailed CV and ‘linked in’ preparation and simulated professional mock interviews. This module is also supported by a series of guest speakers from the Professional bodies, firms and Industry including. The opportunities afforded to the students in meeting these guest speakers is very valuable in building their professional network and career opportunities.  Work Placement is core to this course. It takes place in the second semester of year 3 when the student will have gained competencies in some accounting and business modules. Our goal is to provide you with practical focused skillset you need for the work place. The work placement/work based project takes place in the second semester of year 3 in an accounting/finance work environment when the student has gained competencies in some accounting modules.  Advanced Entry: The course welcomes advanced entry where will take account of prior learning experience for entry to year 2,3 and 4 of the course.
