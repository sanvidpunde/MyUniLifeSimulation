  "course_description": "Physics is the study of matter and energy and their interaction: so it is the study of everything in the physical world. In order to learn about nature it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. This language is mathematics. A physicist uses the tools of experiment and mathematics to uncover the relationships found in nature as Physics. Physicists get to ask the big questions and their work enables them to form answers. Physics describes the Universe from the very largest size (of the Universe itself) to the very small sizes of atoms and even subatomic particles. By asking and answering these big questions rather than simply observing nature, physicists can use the knowledge gained to control natural phenomena in the form of technology. Albert Einstein’s development of General Relativity in the early 20th century was initially used to describe gravity around large celestial bodies such as the Sun, galaxies or even black holes. Einstein’s theory has found modern-day application in the Global Positioning System (GPS) that many of us regularly use to navigate our journeys. Without Einstein’s theory, and the physicists who understood it, GPS would simply not have worked. Quantum Mechanics was developed by physicists to describe the smallest of objects; atoms and subatomic particles. Physicists then identifed how to control the flow of electrons in matter. This work has led directly to the development of modern digital computers. When you use your computer/mobile device you are using the technologies initially developed by physicists. The examples described above involved developing a theory in Physics from conception through to a technological application. Physicists are part of this process at every step from theory to application. This flexibility for physicists in the workplace is one of the strengths of a Physics degree. A Physics degree imparts knowledge of the physical world, along with strong mathematical and problem-solving skills. Physicists also have a broad knowledge of subjects that other disciplines would find dificult to match including Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Thermal Physics, Electromagnetism, Semiconductors, Solid State Physics, and Nanotechnology. The detailed knowledge of these areas ensures that good physics graduates will always be in demand by industry. Physicists can also undertake research in either industry or academia. Faculty in the Department of Physics are actively involved in research in areas such as: Flow batteries for large scale energy storage, Using light to transmit information rather than electrons in wires (Nanoplasmonics), Computational modelling of assemblies comprising millions of atoms to determine properties of various materials, Using electron microscopy to determine the structure of nanoscale materials and to investigate novel 2-D materials like graphene, Microelectromechanical structures and devices for biomedical applications. In your final year of study you will undertake a project working on these or other topics alongside and guided by established researchers in the Department.",
  "course_content": "In the first semester, you will study topics in physics including mechanics, heat, electricity, magnetism, and methods of measurement. You will also study general chemistry and topics in mathematics including linear algebra and calculus. Before the end of Semester 1, you will choose whether you wish to pursue a degree in Applied Physics or Mathematics and Physics The major distinction between these two programmes is that Applied Physics includes physical chemistry and electronics, subjects that the Mathematics and Physics programme omits in favour of developing stronger mathematical skills.",
  "minimum_entry_requirements": "Applicants are required to hold at the time of enrolment the established Leaving Certificate (or an approved equivalent) with a minimum of six subjects which must include: Two H5 (Higher Level) grades and Four O6 (Ordinary Level) grades or four H7 (Higher Level) grades. Subjects must include Mathematics, Irish or another language, and English. In addition, applicants must hold a minimum grade H4 in Mathematics and a grade H4 in any one of the following: Applied Mathematics, Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, Physics with Chemistry. A Special Mathematics Examination will be offered at UL following the Leaving Certificate results for those students who did not achieve the Mathematics requirement. We welcome applications from mature students. Mature applicants must apply through the Central Applications Office (CAO) by 1 February",
  "job_opportunities_and_salary_expectations": "Physics graduates work in jobs such as: Research and Development Engineer Process Engineer Researcher Medical Physicist Consultant/Analyst Software developer Manager Many of our graduates, for instance, are employed by market leaders such as Intel Ireland and Analog Devices. Yet Applied Physics is sufficiently broad in scope that our graduates also work throughout the high technology sector in companies focussed on areas such as energy, telecommunications, medical physics and nano-technology. Recent graduates have established careers in areas like; Semiconductor Devices and Microelectronics Lasers and Optoelectronics Sensors Telecommunications Materials Science Geophysics Bio and Medical Physics Energy Follow-on Study Our graduates have a good understanding of mathematics and experimental techniques allowing further study to MSc and PhD levels in various areas of science, engineering, mathematics and even quantitative areas of finance and economics.",
