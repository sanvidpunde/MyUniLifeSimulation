Ordinary Bachelor Degree,3 Years,Full Time,Face-to-Face,September,Dublin,,https://www.tcd.ie/,"Dental technicians work in a laboratory which is usually remote from the dental clinic. Dental technicians work to the prescription of a dentist; they perform the laboratory aspects of dentistry – fabricating crowns and bridges, dentures, implants, maxillofacial and orthodontic appliances, which are intended for use by the patient. Dental technicians have good manual dexterity skills and are required to work with different materials for the fabrication of the various appliances. Dental technology is a changing field, with more emphasis on the use of CAD (Computer Aided Design)/CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) in the laboratory. 

The study of dental technology will appeal to you if you are interested in science and art, combined with working in a team. If you have an interest in oral health and are simultaneously creatively minded then dental technology may be for you. A good background in basic sciences and a flair for art or good manual dexterity skills are essential to becoming an excellent dental technician. Dental technology also requires precise and scientific expression therefore, good writing skills are important.

Dental Technology at Trinity
Trinity College Dublin is the only university in Ireland offering a degree in Dental Technology. The course is based in the Dublin Dental University Hospital, on the Trinity College, with state-of-the-art facilities, including Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) of dental appliances in close proximity to the clinical environment. Class sizes are small, ensuring that students receive considerable staff contact and the staff are actively involved in student progress throughout the programme.","Dental Technology at Trinity is a three-year ordinary degree programme. Most of the teaching takes place in the Dublin Dental University Hospital (DDUH). The main aim of the course is to educate and train students to become part of the dental team for the planning, designing and fabrication of intra-oral appliances. Dental Technology is divided into four main areas – fixed prosthodontics, complete denture technology, removable denture technology and orthodontic technology. In the first and second years, a Dental Technology student will spend much of their time (6-8 x 3 hour sessions per week) in the DDUH teaching laboratory. The course is very much hands-on right from the start. Student numbers are small (6), which facilitates practical training of this nature. There is a strong emphasis on student integration with Dental Science students and some modules are integrated accordingly.

In the third year, students are assigned to the production laboratory for experience in providing a service to patients and clinicians. This offers a competitive advantage over graduates from many other universities. Liaison with the Dental Science students and clinical staff is encouraged and students are advised to attend in the clinic to observe their completed work in situ. There is the opportunity for students to be placed in external laboratories and there is a possibility of Erasmus exchange in this year too. Students will be busy throughout the year preparing a dissertation, which is presented at the end of the year in addition to a case portfolio of the practical work which the student has carried out over the course of the year.

If you want to work as a software application developer in a variety of commercial and industrial environments, this course will equip you with the understanding and skills needed to progress in an exciting and constantly changing industry.

It will qualify you to work in a wide range of computer development areas – whether in the mainstream computer industry or in stimulating, leading application areas such as internet applications development, games development, enterprise systems, e-commerce, music technology, systems technology, systems security, knowledge management and data mining.

You will spend the early years of the course gaining a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of computer science; then develop highly relevant skills in software design and development. In your final year, you will specialise in a chosen field, such as Enterprise Systems Development (how to create large, scalable, safe, secure and reliable software systems using the latest technologies), Applied Intelligence (advanced methods in computer science such as machine learning and the Internet of Things), Digital Games Development & Simulation (how to design and implement computer games and simulated environments that model novel and complex worlds and characters) and, Security and Forensics (how to recover evidence from a computer system, providing security for information through Steganography and Cryptography algorithms).

The third-year is focused on experiential learning. You will participate in a business and enterprise module, and may then opt to participate in our highly successful work placement course (The School of Computer Science maintain close liaisons with various industry partners). Alternatively, you can work with community organisations on our innovative service-learning module, whereby you take responsibility for interesting ICT projects in the community.

We have institutional links with many industry leaders such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, VMware, Salesforce, SAP, Ocuco, Google, Twitter, Apple, LinkedIn through sponsorship, work placement, project co-operation and graduate employment.

You can apply to participate in an international exchange for the second half of third year as part of your experiential learning.

This four-year course prepares you for a career in professional accountancy and finance and can lead to a contact with an accounting practice. You don’t need to have studied any Leaving Certificate Accounting, Business or Economics subjects. We start at an introductory level, which will prepare you for the more complex concepts that you meet at a later stage in the course. All modules gradually develop students' knowledge with each module building on the knowledge acquired in previous semesters. 

One of the core goals of our department is to enrich the development of our graduates to maximise their employment potential and we embrace the 'T Graduate' concept as a model to achieve this. 

Our core disciplinary skills, as exemplified in the 'T Graduate' concept, are evidenced in the exemptions awarded by professional bodies.  We compliment these skills with strong interpersonal and computer skills.  Along with obtaining skills on accounting packages, the management of big data and an understanding of the digital enablers for accountants, students will also have the opportunity to obtain Microsoft Professional Accreditation. 

Professional Accreditation: On graduation, you’ll qualify for generous exemptions from the professional accountancy bodies, including ACA, ACCA, CIMA, CPA and The Irish Tax Institute.

Progression and Exit Awards: Should your circumstances change, you can postpone your studies or continue them part-time in the evening  or you can exit the course at Level 6 (exiting with a Level 6 Higher Certificate in Accounting) or Level 7 (Bachelor of Business in Accounting & Finance)

Career Planning & Preparation The course is complimented with a Professional Communication & Work Place Preparation module. This provides the students with broader professional communication skills through detailed CV and ‘linked in’ preparation and simulated professional mock interviews. This module is also supported by a series of guest speakers from the Professional bodies, firms and Industry including. The opportunities afforded to the students in meeting these guest speakers is very valuable in building their professional network and career opportunities.

Work Placement is core to this course. It takes place in the second semester of year 3 when the student will have gained competencies in some accounting and business modules. Our goal is to provide you with practical focused skillset you need for the work place. The work placement/work based project takes place in the second semester of year 3 in an accounting/finance work environment when the student has gained competencies in some accounting modules.

Advanced Entry: The course welcomes advanced entry where will take account of prior learning experience for entry to year 2,3 and 4 of the course. Specific recognition is given to the 2 year ATI Diploma and the ACCA Diploma, both of which will provide for advanced entry to year 3, of this 3 year course.","Year 1:
