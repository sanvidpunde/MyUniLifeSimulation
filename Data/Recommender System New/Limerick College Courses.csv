Graduates of this degree programme will play key roles in the research, design, development, test and installation of future systems. They will frequently work in teams to tackle challenging problems. Many of those who graduate from this degree programme also continue their academic studies by pursuing higher degrees by research (e.g., MEng and PhD), or through taught postgraduate programmes (e.g., MSc, MEng, and MBA).

The programme can be undertaken as either a four-year (Bachelor of Engineering, BEng) degree programme or a five-year (Master of Engineering, MEng) degree programme. All students would initially enter the BEng degree programme route, and can either graduate with a BEng degree at the end of the fourth year of study or have the option to continue into the fifth year Masters degree by transferring into the MEng degree programme at the end of the fourth year rather than graduating with a BEng degree.

At the end of the second year, students on the Electronic and Computer Engineering degree programme would select a major option from five major options – Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering, Robotic Engineering, Electrical Energy Engineering, and a General option. Core subjects studied will be augmented by student selected elective subjects that allow the student to identify a focus of specific interest.

The programme of study thus offers excellent choice, thereby enhancing the range employment prospects and future career choice options for the student.","The first two years of the programme is common to all students on the programme and will provide a strong practical and theoretical foundation in computing and programming languages, software, digital and analogue electronics, electrical science, and engineering mathematics. During these first two years of the programme, students will be guided towards their choice of a major option to be undertaken in the years three and four of the programme.

In years three and four of the programme, students select one of the available BEng major options, and decide whether they would want to graduate with a BEng degree award or continue their studies into a fifth year to graduate with a MEng degree award. There is also the opportunity to choose a General option, where students can select modules from the various major option streams rather than specialising on a single major option.

Work experience is obtained through an eight-month period of Cooperative Education (Co-op), which is an integral part of the programme. Co-op will provide students with real-world industrial experience and practice. This will be taken in the summer at the end of second year and the first semester of the third year of the programme.

In year four, the final year of the BEng programme, students aiming to graduate with a BEng degree will undertake a major individual project, which in general aims to solve a real-world problem. The project involves advanced design and implementation work, and builds confidence by putting into practice the skills and knowledge that have been acquired throughout the programme of study.

Master of Engineering (MEng) Track (year five). The MEng track enables students to gain a broader and deeper understanding of a range of advanced topics in electronic & computer engineering including integrated circuit (IC) design, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptography and security, data forensics, and network security, amongst others. Students will also undertake a major individual project. Students will select the MEng track in year three of the programme, and will study the MEng track subjects in year 4.

In order to learn about nature it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. This language is mathematics. A physicist uses the tools of experiment and mathematics to uncover the relationships found in nature as Physics.

Physicists get to ask the big questions and their work enables them to form answers. Physics describes the Universe from the very largest size (of the Universe itself) to the very small sizes of atoms and even subatomic particles. By asking and answering these big questions rather than simply observing nature, physicists can use the knowledge gained to control natural phenomena in the form of technology.

Albert Einstein’s development of General Relativity in the early 20th century was initially used to describe gravity around large celestial bodies such as the Sun, galaxies or even black holes. Einstein’s theory has found modern-day application in the Global Positioning System (GPS) that many of us regularly use to navigate our journeys. Without Einstein’s theory, and the physicists who understood it, GPS would simply not have worked.

Quantum Mechanics was developed by physicists to describe the smallest of objects; atoms and subatomic particles. Physicists then identifed how to control the flow of electrons in matter. This work has led directly to the development of modern digital computers. When you use your computer/mobile device you are using the technologies initially developed by physicists.

The examples described above involved developing a theory in Physics from conception through to a technological application. Physicists are part of this process at every step from theory to application. This flexibility for physicists in the workplace is one of the strengths of a Physics degree. A Physics degree imparts knowledge of the physical world, along with strong mathematical and problem-solving skills.

Physicists also have a broad knowledge of subjects that other disciplines would find dificult to match including Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Thermal Physics, Electromagnetism, Semiconductors, Solid State Physics, and Nanotechnology. The detailed knowledge of these areas ensures that good physics graduates will always be in demand by industry.

Physicists can also undertake research in either industry or academia. Faculty in the Department of Physics are actively involved in research in areas such as:

Flow batteries for large scale energy storage,
Using light to transmit information rather than electrons in wires (Nanoplasmonics),
Computational modelling of assemblies comprising millions of atoms to determine properties of various materials,
Using electron microscopy to determine the structure of nanoscale materials and to investigate novel 2-D materials like graphene,
Microelectromechanical structures and devices for biomedical applications.
In your final year of study you will undertake a project working on these or other topics alongside and guided by established researchers in the Department.","In the first semester, you will study topics in physics including mechanics, heat, electricity, magnetism, and methods of measurement. You will also study general chemistry and topics in mathematics including linear algebra and calculus. Before the end of Semester 1, you will choose whether you wish to pursue a degree in

Applied Physics

or

Mathematics and Physics

The major distinction between these two programmes is that Applied Physics includes physical chemistry and electronics, subjects that the Mathematics and Physics programme omits in favour of developing stronger mathematical skills.","Applicants are required to hold at the time of enrolment the established Leaving Certificate (or an approved equivalent) with a minimum of six subjects which must include: Two H5 (Higher Level) grades and Four O6 (Ordinary Level) grades or four H7 (Higher Level) grades.
